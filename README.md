# Banking Management System with React Frontend and Spring Boot Backend

This project is a full-stack application designed for managing banking customers and their accounts. It consists of two main components:

- **Frontend:** A React-based user interface that allows seamless interaction with customer and account data.
- **Backend:** A Spring Boot application that provides RESTful APIs for managing customer and account information, powered by an H2 database.
